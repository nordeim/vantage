awesome understanding! now, please meticulously extract the complete text from the attached images and then collate into a markdown document `project-overview.md`. Then think deeper and think harder to deeply explore thoroughly and systematically to re-imagine the comprehensive `Project Requirements Document` for the project using the extracted `project-overview.md` as base requirements. Please consult the attached `frontend_design_skillset.md` for the UI/UX design guideline.

awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Next step for you is to think deeper and think harder to deeply and thoroughly explore systematically and meticulously how to re-imagine the actual codebase design and architecture, complete with the file hierarchy and naming. Then meticulously plan and create a comprehensive implementation plan to build the whole frontend codebase in logical phases where each phase can be executed independently with minimal error, and for each phase, list out the files to build, each file with its description and a checklist of features and interfaces. Then review and validate the codebase implementation plan. Present the well-thought-out and validated codebase building implementation plan for my approval.

Below are my answers to your clarifying questions:

1.  Metrics Logic: For the Dashboard, "Monthly Recurring Revenue" is more valuable to me, follow by "Invoiced Totals".  
2.  Client Details: Apart from Name and Email, display notes.  
3.  Invoice Complexity: no, we don't need to handle Taxes like VAT/GST because I am an SMB in Singapore
4.  Currency: SGD since I am Singapore based SMB

awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Before starting with the codebase building plan, please think deeper and think harder to deeply and thoroughly explore systematically and meticulously how to re-imagine an awesome `README.md` for the new GitHub repo to host this project. Make sure the `README.md` is as attractive, comprehensive and informative to attract other contributors. Then meticulously create an implementation plan for the `README.md` with integrated checklist. Review and validate your implementation plan before proceeding meticulously to execute it.
