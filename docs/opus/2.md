# Phase 1: Analysis & Clarification

## Executive Summary

I've conducted a deep analysis of your project overview, draft PRD, and design guidelines. Before presenting the re-imagined comprehensive PRD, I need to surface several **critical clarifications and potential conflicts** that will significantly impact the final document.

## 🔍 Analysis Findings

### A. Identified Conflicts & Ambiguities

| # | Issue | Source Conflict | Impact |
|---|-------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | **Typography Selection** | Draft PRD suggests "Inter Tight" and "Space Grotesk" — but the Design Guidelines explicitly prohibit these as "generic AI aesthetics" to avoid | High - Core design decision |
| 2 | **Design Philosophy Tension** | "Swiss Utility" is minimal/restrained, but Guidelines push for "bold," "unforgettable," and "unexpected" | High - Needs reconciliation |
| 3 | **Serif Usage** | Draft PRD suggests serif fonts (Merriweather) for invoices — is this intended contrast or should we maintain consistency? | Medium |
| 4 | **Color Accent** | "International Orange" or "Electric Blue" mentioned — need to confirm accent choice for brand identity | Medium |
| 5 | **MRR vs Invoiced Totals** | Draft mentions MRR — but for a freelancer invoice tool, is recurring revenue tracking actually needed? | Medium |
| 6 | **Tax/VAT Removal** | Confirmed removed — but should we show a "Discount" field as an alternative line item? | Low |
| 7 | **Invoice Numbering** | No specification for format (e.g., `INV-001`, `2024-0001`, custom prefix?) | Low |

### B. Clarifying Questions

Before finalizing the comprehensive PRD, please confirm or redirect on these points:

#### 🎨 Design Direction

1. **Typography Override**: Given the design guideline's prohibition on generic fonts, may I propose alternative distinctive pairings (e.g., **"Instrument Serif"** + **"Geist"**, or **"Fraunces"** + **"Outfit"**)? Or do you have specific font preferences?

2. **Aesthetic Reconciliation**: Should we interpret "Swiss Utility" as the *foundation* (grid systems, hierarchy, purposeful whitespace) but push it toward a more **"Neo-Editorial"** or **"Precision Brutalist"** execution to satisfy the "bold/unforgettable" guideline?

3. **Accent Color**: Confirm preference:
   - [ ] Electric Blue (e.g., `blue-500`)
   - [ ] Coral/Orange (e.g., `orange-500`)  
   - [ ] Emerald (e.g., `emerald-500`)
   - [ ] Custom suggestion: ___________

4. **Dark Mode Priority**: Should dark mode be the *primary* design (with light as alternative) or vice versa? This affects which gets more polish.

#### 📊 Functional Scope

5. **MRR Tracking**: Is Monthly Recurring Revenue actually needed, or should the dashboard focus on:
   - Total Outstanding
   - Total Paid (This Month / YTD)
   - Overdue Amount
   
6. **Invoice States**: Confirm the status workflow:
   ```
   Draft → Sent/Pending → Paid
                  ↓
               Overdue (auto-calculated from due date?)
   ```

7. **Invoice Numbering Format**: Preference?
   - Auto-increment: `INV-001`, `INV-002`
   - Date-prefixed: `2024-0001`
   - Custom prefix setting?

8. **Line Item Types**: Just simple description + qty + price, or do you need:
   - [ ] Discount lines (negative amounts)
   - [ ] Section headers/grouping
   - [ ] Unit types (hours, items, etc.)

#### 🖥️ Technical Scope

9. **ShadCN Components**: Should I assume all standard ShadCN components are available, or should the PRD specify which to install?

10. **Print Styling**: For the shareable invoice — should it be print-optimized (proper `@media print` considerations via Tailwind)?

### C. Assumptions I Will Make (Unless Corrected)

If you'd like me to proceed without waiting for all answers, I'll assume:

| Assumption | Default Position |
|------------|------------------|
| Typography | I'll propose distinctive alternatives (avoiding Inter/Space Grotesk) |
| Aesthetic | "Modern Precision" — Swiss foundation with editorial boldness |
| Accent Color | Emerald (`emerald-500/600`) — professional yet distinctive |
| Dark Mode | Equal priority, system-preference driven |
| MRR | Removed; focus on invoice-centric metrics |
| Invoice States | Draft → Pending → Paid, with auto-Overdue based on due date |
| Numbering | Auto-increment `INV-001` format |
| Line Items | Simple (Description, Qty, Price) — no discounts/grouping for Phase 1 |
| Print Styling | Yes, included for shareable invoice |

---

## 🛤️ Proposed Path Forward

**Option A — Quick Proceed**: Confirm my assumptions are acceptable, and I'll immediately deliver the comprehensive PRD.

**Option B — Clarification Round**: Answer the specific questions above, and I'll incorporate your preferences into a tailored PRD.

**Option C — Guided Discussion**: We discuss 2-3 key decisions (typography, aesthetic, metrics) together before I finalize.

### Your Response Format

You can reply simply like:

> "Proceed with assumptions. Also: accent color should be blue, and yes to print styling."

Or answer specific numbered questions. I'll adapt accordingly.
