## 📄✨ Introducing *InvoiceForge* — Professional Invoicing, Done Right

If you’re a **solo professional, freelancer, or independent consultant**, and you’ve ever felt that most invoicing tools are either **overkill** or **poorly designed**, I want to share something different.

**InvoiceForge** is an open-source invoicing system built with a very specific philosophy:

> **Invoices are professional documents — not just forms.**

This project is intentionally designed for people who run serious one-person businesses:

* Consultants & advisors
* Freelancers & creatives
* Independent specialists
* Solo founders and owner-operators

Especially in **Singapore**, where clarity, professionalism, and trust matter.

## 🧠 What Makes InvoiceForge Different?

InvoiceForge is **not** trying to be Xero, QuickBooks, or an ERP.

Instead, it focuses on:

* **Clean, authoritative invoices**
* **Structured line items** (sections, discounts, totals done properly)
* **Beautiful, print-ready PDFs**
* **Public invoice links** you can send to clients
* **Simple Stripe payments**
* Clear invoice statuses: *Draft → Pending → Paid / Overdue*

No clutter.
No accounting bloat.
No confusing dashboards.

Just invoices that look like they came from a professional who knows what they’re doing.

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

InvoiceForge is a **perfect fit** if you:

* Run a **solo or micro business**
* Issue **low-volume, high-value invoices**
* Care how your invoices look and read
* Want something **lightweight and trustworthy**
* Don’t want to fight an accounting system just to bill a client

It’s especially suited for:

* Consultants
* Designers & developers
* Coaches & trainers
* Independent professionals
* Early-stage founders billing clients directly

---

## 🚫 Who Is It *Not* For?

To be clear (and honest):

* It’s **not** built for large accounting teams
* Not for GST-heavy, compliance-driven workflows
* Not for high-volume transactional businesses

And that’s by design.

InvoiceForge is about **focus, precision, and calm authority**.

## 🛠️ Built for Builders (Open Source)

InvoiceForge is:

* **Open source**
* Built with **Ruby on Rails + React**
* Domain-driven and deliberately simple
* Designed to be extended thoughtfully — not hacked together

If you’re a developer who values:

* Clean domain models
* Well-structured services
* Thoughtful UI architecture
* Products with taste and restraint

You’ll feel right at home.

---

## ⭐ Why This Matters

Most tools chase *features*.
InvoiceForge chases **clarity**.

It’s an experiment in building software that:

* Respects its users
* Does one thing exceptionally well
* Ages gracefully

If this resonates with you — as a user or contributor — I’d love for you to take a look.
